# *T*e*r*minal fl*ashcards*

The concept of this project is to create a terminal based flashcards software. So it'd be possible for users to learn from flashcards in the terminal. __Please note that there are already existing implementations for such an application (and you should check those out).__ This is a project to test stuff that doesn't make much sense and just to mess around.

# The END GOAL

![HUH](huhcat.gif)

Is basically this gif, so to have an app that functions, but has questionable implementations in it.
